This is a toy program I made using C# .NET and Unity for my Heursitic Optimization Course, It is a toy visualization tool for learning different 2D grid based pathfinding algorithms.

Features:  
- Change Grid Size
- Set Start and End Nodes
- Set Obstacles
- Choose Alpgorthm to run: BFS, Djistras, Greedy and A*
- Run Pathfinding Per Step or Untill End Node is Found

### Project Overview
I proposed to do a teaching orientated project where I will be covering the topic of pathfinding algorithms and their implementation with the focus on the A* algorithm and a 2D grid world representation. To demonstrate my understanding I would also develop an interactive visualization tool which will be used for testing and teaching the pathfinding algorithms.  
Project Overview
#### Report
The report will offer an overview of efficient pathfinding using heuristics, covering its motivations, spatial constraints, and exploration of key algorithms within the context of a 2D grid world representation. The report will use the custom interactive application functions as a practical tool, aiding in the visualization and comprehension of the performance and characteristics of these pathfinding algorithms.
#### Presentation
The final presentation will be an educational talk on pathfinding algorithms and how their implementation works. Then I will follow up the talk with an interactive demo application for everyone to engage with. Why include an interactive demo? Well, Iâ€™m a believer that people grasp concepts more effectively when they can actively engage with them. So, after the talk, I've prepared a hands-on demo for everyone to participate in and experience the A* pathfinding algorithm in action. Moreover, this project offers a valuable addition to my personal portfolio. Given i aspire to work in the domain of interactive computer graphics, i see it as an opportunity to elegantly merge this aspect in my final project.
Interactive Visualization Tool 
This application will enable users to run and visualize various pathfinding algorithms in real-time. Importantly runtime statistics will be generated to observe varying algorithms performance and behavioral characteristics under different circumstances.
